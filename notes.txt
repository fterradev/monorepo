It seems like lerna adds automatically many packages to root node_modules, without ever having chosen to add them.
Including tsconfig-paths - thus I didn't have to install it.

But, in the end, I actually needed to install tsconfig-paths, because:
1. I needed cwd parameter, which is only available in version 4 - while lerna ships with version 3.
2. And maybe having a tsconfig-paths module per package was also needed to make each package mapping work.

About errors in jsconfig.json.
When you first add a references entry to a package, that requires some updates in the refered jsconfig.
Like adding the composite property.
And at first it also requires "noEmit": false.
But you can ignore the latter and just restart vs code.
